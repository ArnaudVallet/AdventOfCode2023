# Advent of Code 2023 <!-- omit in toc -->
For my first time doing the advent of code, my friends and I decided to try it out using a language we were not familiar with : `Rust`.

It was a challenging and also a lot of fun seing we all had different approach resolving each days. Our code structure and patterns were also really different as we all work with different technologies.

Tried my best making each day rustier than its previous one, enjoy ðŸ˜‰.
